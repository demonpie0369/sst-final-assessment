  <h2>Riley's paragraph</h2>
  <p>This image relates to colonisation because it shows Hone Heke striking back against the colonisers. For example, not only is the town, named Kororareka, on fire, but Hone Heke is in the foreground chopping down the flag. This is a symbolic form of protest and shows us that Hone Heke is angry about the land confiscation and angry about how the British have lied to him. This links back into colonisation because it shows us that it upset a lot of people.

This image relates to colonisation because it shows lots of people get hurt in the process of colonisation. For example, Kororareka being on fire shows that, in the process of colonisation, when people are angry about it, they fight back. Casualties happen on both sides. Colonisation is always going to be oppressing and/or assimilating one side and glorifying the other. This obviously upsets the side being oppressed. This will cause riots, and actions taken in self-defence. It will also force them to send a message, which can sometimes be violent, or even deadly. All of this happens because of colonisation.</p>
